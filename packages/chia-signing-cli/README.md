# Chia DID Signing CLI

## Proposed Signing Protocol

As a first step to establishing a decentralized DID reputation 
and trust graph system, this package demonstrates a protocol
for signing and verifying messages from Chia DID's using the Chia Wallet RPC.

Messages are JSON strings in the format
```JSON
{
  "did": "DID",
  "message": "body",
  "sig": "signature"
}
```

`sig` is generated by DID's Wallet signing the JSON stringified array `[did, message]`

## Using the utility
For version 0.1.x you must be running the chia wallet to sign and verify message.

[chia-agent](https://github.com/Chia-Mine/chia-agent) is used to interact with the chia daemon and wallet.

### Sign a message
Execute `npx chia-signing-cli did-sign`

If you have more than one key, you will be prompted to select the key to sign with.

### Verify a message
Execute `npx chia-signing-cli verify`
