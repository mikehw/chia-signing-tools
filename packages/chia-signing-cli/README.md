# Chia DID Signing CLI

## Proposed Signing Protocol

As a first step to establishing a decentralized DID reputation 
and trust graph system, this package demonstrates a protocol
for signing and verifying messages from Chia DIDs using the Chia Wallet RPC.

Messages are JSON strings in the format
```JSON
{
  "did": "DID",
  "msg": "body",
  "sig": "signature"
}
```

`sig` is generated by DID's Wallet signing the `msg` string.

## Using the utility
For version 0.2.x you must be running the chia wallet to sign and verify the message.

[chia-agent](https://github.com/Chia-Mine/chia-agent) is used to interact with the chia daemon and wallet.

### Sign a message
Execute `npx -p chia-signing-cli did-sign`

If you have more than one key, you will be prompted to select the key to sign with.

### Verify a message
Execute `npx -p chia-signing-cli verify`

### Version Compatibility
Version 0.1.x used the property "message" instead of "msg" in the JSON message format, and signed both the did and the message.  Version 0.2.x uses the property "msg" and only signs the message. The verify command will accept either format.
